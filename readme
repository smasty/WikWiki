Installation
============

No special installation steps are required. Just copy the source file (index.php),
the Texy! formatter file (texy.min.php) and the stylesheet (style.css) to your
desired folder.

Make sure that PHP has write access to the folder. WikWiki will try to create
a data folder automatically. If it fails, you'll be asked to create it manually.

For installation of ReCaptcha, write your public and secret key to
_captcha_codes.php and remove the first underscore in the filename. If you
won't do this, no reCapcha is used.
